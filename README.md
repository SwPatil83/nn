**Problem statement: **
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of 
melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

**Dataset Information**
The dataset consists of 2357 images (2239 Images in Train Folder and 118 in Test Folder) of malignant and benign oncological diseases,
which were formed by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

**Steps Involved**
Data Loading

Baseline Model Building

Training the Model and testing the model

Building an augmented model

Training the augmented model and testing the model

Countering Class Imbalance with augmentor

Building the final model

Training the final model and testing the model


**Result**

The training accuracy and validation accuracy are almost same. This is a sign of good fit.
The training loss and validation loss are almost same. This is a sign of good fit.
The Validation accuracy is 0.87 which is good. The model is able to classify the images with 87% accuracy.

**Libraries Used:**
TensorFlow Version 2.15.0
Python 3

Note: The python Notebook was created on Google Collab with data on Google Drive
